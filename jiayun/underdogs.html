						Seven years after graduating from university, 
						Rowling saw herself as a failure.
						Her marriage had failed, 
						and she was jobless with a dependent child.
						During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide.
						Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, 
						soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.
						Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, 
						describing her economic status as being "poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, 
						without being homeless.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter 
						and the Philosopher's Stone on an old manual typewriter.
						Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, 
						a reader who had been asked to review the book's 
						first three chapters, 
						the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agents 
						agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. 
						The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, 
						all of which rejected the manuscript.
						A year later she was finally given the green light 
						and a £1,500 advance by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, 
						a publishing house in London.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Harry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15 billion,
						and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records 
						as the fastest-selling books in history. 
						The series, totalling 4,195 pages, has been translated, 
						in whole or in part, into 65 languages, 
						besides being made into films. 
						In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful 
						in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. 
						In 2017, Rowling was worth an estimated £650 million according 
						to the Sunday Times Rich List.  
						She established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its 
						annual budget of £5.1 million to combat poverty and social inequality. 
						The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, 
						and multiple sclerosis research.
